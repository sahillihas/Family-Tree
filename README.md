# Family Tree

**Family Tree** is a collaborative platform that allows people to build, visualize, and explore their extended family network. Users can add their family members and connect with relatives they might not even be aware of. The platform enables the formation of long, interconnected family trees with the help of contributions from multiple users.

## Features

### Add Family Members  
Add parents, children, siblings, spouses, and more to build a personal family tree.

### Discover Unknown Relatives  
Connect with extended or long-lost relatives through shared family connections contributed by others.

### Interactive Family Graph  
Visualize the entire family as an interactive and expandable tree structure.

### Collaborative Tree Building  
Allow multiple users to contribute to the same family tree, growing it collectively over time.

### Search and Explore  
Search for names, relationships, or branches within the tree to learn more about your ancestry.

### Privacy Controls  
Manage visibility and editing permissions for your family information, keeping sensitive data protected.

### Historical View  
Trace back generations and understand your familyâ€™s lineage over time.

### Relationship Mapping  
Automatically identify how one person is related to another within the tree.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to create a dynamic, shared space where families can document their history, uncover connections, and preserve their heritage for future generations.
